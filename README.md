Hello 👋🏽, this repository contains the code for my personal website. It is build using Next.js (yes it is overkill, but I wanted to try it out) and TailwindCSS. It is hosted on Vercel and you chan check it out on [here](https://jakub-abrahoim.vercel.app).

If you have any questions or suggestions you can get in touch using the contact links on the website.
